This is my version of the DSAI Hands-on Project from Oemoem.
Note that I am still a beginner and the result of the training model and learning curve may be false.

The training model uses Logistic Regression, the perfect accuracy score is unusual and suggests that your model might be overfitting or that there is some other issue in the data or model setup.
